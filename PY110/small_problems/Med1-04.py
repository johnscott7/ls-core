# This is a long problem
# a stack-and-register programming language is one that uses a 
# stack instead of variables for all of its data. Each operation in the language
# operates on a register, which can be thought of as the current value. The
# register is not part of the stack.

'''
An operation that requires two values pops the topmost item from the stack
(i.e., the operation removes the most recently pushed value from the stack),
operates on the popped value and the register value, then stores the result back in the register.

This sounds complex, but the behavior is straightforward to walk through manually.
Consider a MULT operation in a stack-and-register language. It pops the topmost value
from the stack, multiplies the popped value with the current value in the register,
then replaces the register content with the result value. For example, suppose we start
with a stack of [3, 6, 4] (where 4 is the topmost item in the stack) and a register value
of 7, the MULT operation mutates the stack to [3, 6] (the 4 is popped), and the result of
the multiplication, 28, is left in the register. If we do another MULT at this point, the
stack is mutated to [3], and the register is left with the value 168.

Write a function that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming
language that has the following commands (also called operations or tokens):

n: Place an integer value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.
PUSH : Push the current register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the register.
ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing the result in the register.
SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value, storing the result in the register.
MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value, storing the result in the register.
DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value, storing the integer 
result back in the register.
REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value,
storing the integer remainder of the division back in the register.
POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
PRINT : Print the register value.
All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and REMAINDER).

Programs will be supplied to your language function via a string argument. Your function may assume that all arguments
are valid programs -- i.e., they will not do anything like trying to pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they won't contain any unknown tokens.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.
